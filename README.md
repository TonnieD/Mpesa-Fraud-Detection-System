# M-Pesa Fraud Detection System

A real-time transaction fraud detection and prevention system built for the Kenyan mobile money ecosystem. The system intercepts M-Pesa transactions before settlement and returns an `ALLOW`, `CHALLENGE`, or `BLOCK` decision within the latency window of a transaction initiation.

---

## Problem Statement

M-Pesa processes **37.15 billion transactions annually**, with a total value of **KSh 38.29 trillion**. Conservative estimates place annual fraud losses at **KSh 2.3 billion (~$17.6M USD)** — approximately KSh 6.3 million stolen every single day.

Common attack vectors include SIM swaps, social engineering, fraudulent merchant transactions, number masking, and fake balance SMS traps.

---

## Solution

Rather than logging fraud after the fact, this system sits **between transaction initiation and transaction completion**, scoring each transaction in real time and returning one of three decisions:

| Decision | Condition |
|---|---|
| `ALLOW` | Low fraud probability — transaction proceeds normally |
| `CHALLENGE` | Elevated risk — OTP or user verification triggered |
| `BLOCK` | High fraud probability or deterministic fraud signal — transaction halted before settlement |

## ML Pipeline

### Data
- **Source:** Synthetic M-Pesa fraud dataset — [Kaggle (calebboen)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/calebboen/mpesa-transactions-fraud)
- **Size:** 120,000 transactions × 13 features
- **Fraud rate:** 2.93% (class imbalanced)

### Feature Engineering
| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| `drain_rate` | `(amount / sender_balance_before) × 100` — primary fraud signal |
| `account_emptied` | Binary flag — transaction amount >= sender balance |
| `hour_sin/cos` | Cyclical encoding of hour (cycle length: 24) |
| `day_sin/cos` | Cyclical encoding of day of week (cycle length: 7) |
| `month_sin/cos` | Cyclical encoding of month (cycle length: 12) |

### Models Compared
| Model | Recall (Fraud) | Precision (Fraud) | F1 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Logistic Regression | 0.47 | 0.03 | 0.05 |
| Random Forest | 0.54 | 0.03 | 0.06 |
| XGBoost (base) | 0.62 | 0.03 | 0.06 |
| LightGBM (base) | 0.62 | 0.03 | 0.06 |
| **XGBoost (tuned)** | **0.68** | **0.03** | **0.06** |

### Selected Model
**XGBoost** tuned with GridSearchCV + SMOTE (via imblearn Pipeline)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| `max_depth` | 4 |
| `learning_rate` | 0.01 |
| `colsample_bytree` | 0.5 |
| Class imbalance | SMOTE inside CV folds |

### Final Evaluation (Unseen Data)
Evaluated against 10,000 completely unseen transactions with original 97/3 class ratio preserved:

| Metric | Score |
|---|---|
| Recall (fraud) | 0.68 |
| Precision (fraud) | 0.03 |
| Accuracy | 0.35 |

## Decisioning Architecture

Transactions are evaluated in two layers before a decision is returned:

**Layer 1 — Hard Rules (deterministic, no model inference):**
- `drain_rate >= 100%` → immediate `BLOCK` (transaction exceeds available balance)
- `account_emptied = 1` → immediate `BLOCK` (transaction empties sender account)

**Layer 2 — Model Inference (probabilistic):**
- `probability >= 0.502` → `BLOCK`
- `probability >= 0.497` → `CHALLENGE`
- `probability < 0.497` → `ALLOW`

- `day_of_week`: `Monday`, `Tuesday`, `Wednesday`, `Thursday`, `Friday`, `Saturday`, `Sunday`

## Known Limitations

- Precision is stuck at 0.03 across all models — a consequence of the synthetic dataset's uniform fraud distribution. Only `drain_rate` and `account_emptied` carry genuine predictive signal.
- SMOTE applied to synthetic data may inflate metrics beyond what is achievable on real M-Pesa transaction data.
- Categorical inputs are case-sensitive and must match training data values exactly. Frontend should use constrained inputs (dropdowns) to prevent encoder errors.
- Model does not capture SIM swap fraud, agent float abuse, or number masking as explicit features.
